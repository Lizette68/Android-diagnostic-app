# smartphone-bci - The Android app:

This is the Android app for the [SmartphoneBCI project] (https://jmanart.github.io/smartphone-bci-hardware/).
It allows to visualise the data read from the [SmartphoneBCI hardware ] (https://github.com/jmanart/smartphone-bci-hardware/)

There are three tabs (change from one to another by swiping) 







TODO:
 - Use a C/C++ fft implementation.
 - Move the driver functionality to a separate project so it can be easily used in other apps.
 - The code is a bad state due to different rushes and time constrains, it needs a clean up.
